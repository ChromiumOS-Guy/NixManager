# NixManager

NixManager is a GUI for un/installing and managing Nix package manager.

Originally started [here](https://gitlab.com/ChromiumOS-Guy/lomiri-system-settings/-/tree/nix-manager?ref_type=heads).

Then moved [here](https://gitlab.com/ChromiumOS-Guy/lomiri-system-settings-nixmanager).

May move to an offical Ubports repo on gitlab as there were already plans to do so, as seen [here](https://gitlab.com/ubports/development/core/lomiri-system-settings-nixmanager) and as discussed on telegram group.

There is an [example video](https://github.com/ChromiumOS-Guy/NixManager/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/current-example.mp4) in assets.
